# Chemical-and-Biomedical-Engineering-Calculations-Using-Python-Solutions

I created this repository to host the solutions I have developed to the questions found  at the end of each chapter in the book detailed above, given that I could not find solutions elsewhere to which I could compare my own.

I am in no way affiliated with the author, publisher or relevant body assosciated with the book - I just wish to share the code I have developed to help others and have my own code reviewed by anyone also using the book.

I am still working through the book and will endeavour to upload as often as possible.
